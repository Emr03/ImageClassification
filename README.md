#  COMP 551 - Mini-Project 3: Image Classification
The second project for COMP 551 - Applied Machine Learning.

This repository contains various algorithms used to classify images into
forty categories.
Using the InceptionV3 model, we achieved a score of 89.152% accuracy on
an unseen testing data.

## Dependencies

Before running any of the models, install:
* numpy
* tensorflow
* pandas
* opencv
* keras



## Running the models

To run the Keras model, run:
```
python cnn_pretrain.py
```
To run the InceptionV3 model, run:

```
python tensorFlow.py
```

To run the Logistic Regression model, run:

```
python LogisticRegression.py
```
To run the Neural Network model, run:

```
python nn_cross_val.py
```
To test the Neural Network model on scikit-learn's digits dataset run 

...
python digits_cross_val.py
...

## Included directories
The output file for the logistic regression model are found in the output folder. The results for the InceptionV3 model are directly generated by the tensorFlow program.
